### 1. **Introduction**
This project aims to design and implement a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) compiler tailored for scientific computing. Scientific computing often involves specialized computations, and the need for custom language solutions is becoming more critical in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and finance. The motivation behind this project is to simplify complex mathematical expressions and computations, enhance the performance of scientific code, and allow users to interact with scientific problems in a more intuitive way. By building this DSL, we aim to bridge the gap between high-level mathematical problems and efficient low-level implementations, making scientific computing more accessible and efficient.

### 2. **Problem Statement**
- Current general-purpose programming languages lack the necessary abstraction and performance optimizations for specific scientific computing tasks.
- The need for a tailored solution arises to enable scientists and researchers to express complex algorithms and models more naturally and efficiently.
- Existing tools are either too slow or require excessive lines of code for what should be simple operations in scientific computing.

### 3. **Objectives**
- **Design** a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) focused on scientific computing, with syntax and semantics that align with the needs of researchers and engineers.
- **Implement** a compiler for the DSL that can convert high-level scientific language into optimized executable code.
- **Optimize** the performance of the generated code, targeting common scientific computing operations like matrix manipulations, differential equations, and large-scale simulations.
- **Provide** a user-friendly interface for scientists and engineers to write and test their models and algorithms.

### 4. **Methodology**
- **Language Design**: The first step involves designing the syntax and semantics of the DSL, focusing on ease of use and clarity.
- **Compiler Development**: Build a compiler that takes DSL code as input and generates optimized low-level code, either in C++ or another performant language.
- **Optimization**: Implement various code optimization techniques to improve the runtime efficiency of scientific computations.
- **Testing & Validation**: Run benchmarks on real scientific problems to validate the accuracy and performance of the DSL and its compiler.
